# ### In this notebook, Data Science Tools are sumerized

# **Objectives:**
#     
# - Popular languages for Data Science
# - Commonly used libraries
# - Evaluating arithmetic expressions in python

# #### Here are a few of the popular languages that Data Scientists use:
# 
# 1. Python
# 2. R
# 3. SQL
# 4. Java
# 5. Julia
# 

# #### Some of the commonly  used libraries include:
# 
# 1. Pandas
# 2. Numpy
# 3. Scikit-learn
# 4. Matplotlib
# 5. TensorFlow

# ### Below are a few examples of evaluating arithmetic expressions in python

# _This is a simple arithmetic expression to multiply then add integers_

# In[6]:


(3*4)+5


# _This will convert 200 minutes to hours by driving 60_

# In[7]:


200/60
